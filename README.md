## The Game

### Important Points
1. You do not need to connect a wallet to play but connecting wallet allows you to select the skins. If both players have their wallet connected, they can agree to register the winner.
2. Zoom in/out if unable to see all pieces and map according to your comfort.
3. Read the How-to-play on Home page to know about the instructions.
4. For the online site, it may happen that the server does not respond due to being inactive after a period of inactivity as it was hosted on a free tier.

## Creating and Joining room
A player can create room and get the room code which can then be shared with the other player, and both can jump into a game.

## Connect Wallet and Skins
A player can choose to connect their wallet. The code is set up to connect to etherlink testnet . Although it is also set to ask permission to add the testnet if not present in user's metamask, if facing issue, make sure to add and switch to etherlink testnet before connecting wallet. Else if connected wallet but not on etherlink testnet, you will be able to see current skins and the ones for collab but will be unable to buy the skins through smart contract.

### Current skins
Shows the current equipped skins of the player. Go to lobby, reload page, and come back if you want to change to default skins after changing the skins.

### Available skins

### Collab skins

## Registering the winner
